# Cyclopic-DigitalTwin-Balance

This is a 2D Pygame environment to be improved to implement RL to balance vehicle height for pitch angle of vehicle.

Assumption is vehicle move with an acceleration. This acceleration might cause center of gravity is out of support and might cause load(shelf) to fall down.

TO DO:
  * Make code functional.
  * Improve connections
  * Implement RL (PPO).
  * Improve visual components


Requirements:
 - pygame
